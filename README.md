# Hello there, I'm Ben

I'm an aspiring data analyst from Northern California who's passionate about helping companies make data-driven decisions to ensure their businesses run efficiently. Although I'm rather new to GitHub, I've been actively using my profile to display entertaining projects I've worked on over the past few months while scouring GitHub and Kaggle for interesting datasets. My projects are designed to be user-friendly, so feel free to follow along if you're an aspiring analyst looking to practice like I am. While all my projects exhibited here are in Jupyter Notebook, I also frequently use SQL to query data and Tableau or Excel to visualize data. And eventhough I'm well-versed in R, I greatly prefer Python because it is much more applicable to other fields and is significantly faster. Whichever language or software platform you use, I hope you check out a few of my projects and find them insightful in some way!

Outside of the programming world, you can find me rolling on the mats at your local BJJ gym or searching for random foreign people to talk to improve my Spanish and French. Nature is pretty cool too, go hug a tree to ward off the loneliness of being stuck indoors. I also love the shooting range and barbecue, so don't you dare call me a hippie for being Californian or for hugging trees.
